# FlashUI (Nitro React client)

A modified UI for the Nitro React client from Billsonnn.
Installation process is the same as for setting up the normal client.

We recommend you to use the main-branch because thats the one that probably will be most stable.

Dev branch will be more updated but their will be risk for bugs, if you find any issues within the dev-branch please report them here on the Git.

If you ever see a branch with the name "bug-fixes" or something similar do not use it on your hotel because that is only a branch for developers, that branch is when we pull all the updates from original Nitro V2 and there might be issues that needs to be fixed first before its ready to use.
